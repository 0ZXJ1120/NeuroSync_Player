# NeuroSync_Player
Some code to test the api.

Go to /utils/neurosync_api_connect.py and enter your api key.
Add your elevenlabs key in the elevenlabs file in utils too, or pipe your own in with the mic or a wave instead with the other py samples.

This is to get you started with Neurosync, livelink and UE5 integration - not for production, obviously.
